# Naughty Scripts

## e621-get-pool.sh

Due to recent changes in the API, https://github.com/Toksyuryel/utilities/blob/master/e621-get.sh is no longer operative. This script allows to download an entire image pool from e621.net.

## fawget2.sh

This script downloads galleries from FurAffinity. FurAffinity does not expose a public API. The normal HTML is scraped, so it probably only works with the template "Modern".
